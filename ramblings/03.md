# Diary Entry - 2024-11-04

*Not a great day today. Sometimes things just feel off, you know?*

I tried to keep myself busy with little tasks around the house—cleaned the kitchen, organized a few drawers—but couldn’t shake the mood. Ended up calling a friend and just venting, which helped.

- **Highlight:** Chatting with Sarah and laughing at our own terrible jokes.
- **Mood:** Low but getting better
