# Diary Entry - 2024-11-03

Today, I went to a new coffee shop downtown and loved it! The place had that rustic, cozy vibe and the best caramel latte I've had in a while. I brought my sketchbook and spent a couple of hours doodling by the window.

- **Highlight:** That first sip of latteâ€”*perfection*.
- **Mood:** Inspired
