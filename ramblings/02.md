# Diary Entry - 2024-11-05

Today was a whirlwind at work! I didn’t think I’d survive my inbox, but somehow, I pulled through.

**Main takeaway:** Time management is essential, but breaks are, too. 

In the evening, I went for a run, and it felt like I was finally shaking off all the stress. Came home, cooked some pasta, and crashed with a movie.

- **Highlight:** Seeing the sunset while running by the lake.
- **Mood:** Accomplished
